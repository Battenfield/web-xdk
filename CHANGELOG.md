# Web XDK Change Log

## 1.0.0-pre2.0 (unreleased)

* Adds `multiple` property to FileUploadWidget
* Fixes bug in rendering of a carousel of images when generated by FileUploadWidget
* JSDuck on Message Type UIs
* Layer.Core.Query.ConversationQuery and other queries can not be explicitly accessed to modify the `MaxPageSize` static property
* Message Type Model now has a `getParticipantResponse()` method for extracting participant responses to a Model.
* Adds `message.createModel()` to get the Message Type Model representing the `Layer.Core.Message` instance
* Adds `part.createModel()` to get the Message Type Model representing the `Layer.Core.MessagePart` instance
* Adds `message.getRootPart()` to get the root MessagePart for the Message
* Adds `model.getParentModel()` to get the Parent Model of the current Model (or `null` if its already the root model)
* API Reference for Message Type Models
* Renamed ReceiptModel property  `shippingAddressModel` => `shippingAddress` and `billingAddressModel` => `billingAddress`
* Renamed:
    * `<layer-standard-display-container />` to `<layer-standard-message-view-container />`
    * `<layer-titled-display-container />` to `<layer-titled-message-view-container />`
    * All Message Types are renamed with the following pattern: `<layer-xxx-view />` to `<layer-xxx-message-view />`
    * Removed support for putting a `selectedAnswer` in the constructor for a Choice Model.  Instead use the `preselectedChoice` property.
* Registered Message Action handlers are no longer called with `<layer-message-viewer />` as context, and instead receive inputs of `({data, model, rootModel, messageViewer})` where model and rootModel represent the model the event was triggered upon and any root Message Model (Carousel for example) that contains the model.
* Triggering an action now first triggers a DOM level event with the name of the action. A call to `evt.preventDefault()` will prevent the Registered Message Action Handler from being called, and will let your event handler alone handle it.
* `layer-send-message` event now passes a Layer.Core.MessageTypeModel instead of an array of Layer.Core.MessagePart objects
* `<layer-compose-bar />` has updated its public API around creating/sending messages. Most apps should not be using this, but handy for custom widgets being embedded into the Compose Bar.
* `<layer-file-upload-button />` events have all been redefined
* `<layer-conversation-view />`
    * `onSendMessage` and `layer-send-message` event properties have changed, Message is no longer a property of this event, instead `model` is provided, and `model.message` can be used if Message access is required.
    * `autoFocusConversation` now takes Contstants rather than Strings as inputs
* `layer-composer-change-value` and `onComposerChangeValue` events are now `layer-compose-bar-change-event` and `onComposeBarChangeValue`; `evt.detail.value` is now `evt.detail.newValue`
* `deleteConversationEnabled` has been removed from `<layer-conversation-list />` and `<layer-conversation-item />`
* `<layer-conversation-list />` `sortBy` property now requires values of `Layer.UI.Constants.CONVERSATIONS_SORT.LAST_MESSAGE` or `Layer.UI.Constants.CONVERSATIONS_SORT.CREATED_AT`; prior values are no longer valid
* `<layer-identity-item />` property `selected` renamed to `isSelected`
* Choice Model now has a `selectedChoice` property (Readonly, single-select only) to get the Choice object that is currently selected
* Message Type Models no longer emit a `change` event, and now intsead emit a `message-type-model:change` event.
* Message Type Models now emit a `message-type-model:customization` event to allow for customization of behaviors
* Layer.Core.LayerEvent (i.e. any event triggered by non-UI-components) now supports
  * `evt.preventDefault()`: Can be called on any event where `evt.cancelable` is `true` to prevent a default behavior (very few uses of this at the moment)
  * `evt.returnValue()`: Can be called on any event that is providing an opportunity for you to provide an alternate value for it to use.  Currently used by some `message-type-model:customization` events
* Layer.UI.Menu `options` property is now an `items` property
* `<layer-status-message />` can now be configured with properties without having to completely rewrite the `onRender` method for each customization
* CSS Class `layer-root-card` renamed to `layer-root-viewer`
* Twemoji emojis can be disabled using `Layer.init({useEmojiImages: false})`
* List Item no longer provide an `addClass` `removeClass` and `toggleClass` method (`toggleClass` is now a part of all UI Components)
